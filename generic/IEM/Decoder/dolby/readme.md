# Generic panner presets

This directory contains panner presets for standard speaker setups to be used
e.g. with the IEM AllRADecoder or the SimpleDecoder.  They are modeled after the
speaker placement descriptions provided by Dolby
(https://www.dolby.com/about/support/guide/speaker-setup-guides/) and Fiedler
Audio's implementation in the /Dolby Atmos Composer/
(https://fiedler-audio.com/dolby-atmos-composer/).

For Nuendo (and presumably Cubase) 9.1.6 order is different, as are the
'wide' angles. See/use 9.1.6-nuendo.json
